        <h1>Sheet Apps</h1>
        <p>Cut down on your screen time by printing out these activity sheets. These sheets were
            made in place of making an app because sometimes paper works just fine and feels
            better to use!

            <h4>Habit Builder</h4>
            <p class="description"><em>
                Choose up to 10 daily habits that you want to start or continue with and keep track of your
                progress day to day. Visually appealing and satisfying to check off all of the healthy habits for 
                the day. A good tip for successfully maintaining a habit is to choose something you can do in 5 minutes or less,
            and then do more only when you feel like it.</em>

            Choose up to two subjects per sheet that may be difficult to get done or keep up with (like exercise), then write down
            all your motivations, purpose and encouragement for keeping up with the activity so you can look back on it
            every time it's difficult to continue.
